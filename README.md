# [Anatomy of a WordPress Theme Template File][published url]
## Instructor: [Rachel McCollin][instructor url]



Understanding the code inside a theme template file is an important part of learning how to create your own WordPress themes. With custom templates you have the ability to change any aspect of the way your site is rendered, or even to build your own theme from scratch. But first you'll have to understand how a template works. And what better way than by studing a theme from the WordPress team itself?

In this course, Envato Tuts+ instructor Rachel McCollin will walk you through the main template files of the WordPress Twenty Sixteen theme. You'll learn how a template file works, how the different parts fit together, and how templates can be split up into modules.
